## Employee Management System

This C++ program is an Employee Management System that allows users to perform various operations such as entering employee data, displaying employee data, searching for specific employee data, updating employee data, and deleting employee data. The program includes a simple authentication system for user login.

### Features:

1. **Employee Data Entry:** Users can enter data for multiple employees including their name, ID, address, contact number, and salary.

2. **Display Data:** Users can view the data of all entered employees, including their name, ID, address, contact number, and salary.

3. **Search Data:** Users can search for a specific employee's data by entering their ID.

4. **Update Data:** Users can update the information of an existing employee by entering their ID and providing new data.

5. **Delete Data:** Users have the option to delete either a specific employee's data or all the employee data.

6. **User Authentication:** The program includes a signup process where a new user can create a username and password. Upon subsequent logins, users need to enter their username and password for authentication.

### Usage:

1. **Signup:**
   - Upon running the program, users are prompted to create a new username and password.

2. **Login:**
   - After signup, users can log in using their username and password.

3. **Main Menu:**
   - Once logged in, users are presented with a menu of options to perform various operations.

4. **Operations:**
   - Users can select from the following options:
     - Enter data (1)
     - Show data (2)
     - Search data (3)
     - Update data (4)
     - Delete data (5)
     - Logout (6)
     - Exit (7)

5. **Data Manipulation:**
   - Users can perform operations to manage employee data as per their requirements.

6. **Logout and Exit:**
   - Users can logout to return to the login screen or choose to exit the program entirely.

### Notes:

- The program includes basic error handling for invalid inputs.
- Passwords are stored in plain text, which is not secure. For a more secure implementation, consider using encryption techniques.
- Usernames and passwords are hardcoded into the program, which is not recommended for production use. In a real-world scenario, user authentication would be handled using a secure database and encryption.
- The program utilizes the `<conio.h>` library for getch() function, which is specific to Windows. For cross-platform compatibility, consider alternative input methods.

### Compatibility:

- The program is designed to run on Windows platforms due to its usage of the `<conio.h>` library and system commands.
- Some adjustments may be required for compatibility with other operating systems.
- Compile the program using a C++ compiler compatible with Windows.

### Security Considerations:

- Avoid sharing usernames and passwords with unauthorized users.
- Regularly update passwords for enhanced security.
- Handle sensitive employee data with care to maintain privacy and confidentiality.

### Future Improvements:

- Implement secure authentication mechanisms using hashing and salting techniques.
- Add error handling for edge cases and invalid inputs.
- Enhance user interface for better user experience.
